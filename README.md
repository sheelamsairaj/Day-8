# 🛡️ Elevate Labs Cyber Security Internship - Task 8: VPN Privacy & Security Evaluation

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this task was to gain hands-on experience with a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and understand its critical role in protecting user privacy and securing online communication.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* **Free VPN Client:** [State which one you used: e.g., ProtonVPN Free Tier]
* **IP Verification Service:** [e.g., whatismyipaddress.com]
* **Operating System:** [e.g., Windows 11 / macOS Sonoma]

## 📋 Deliverables

The following files are included in this repository:

1.  **`Task_8_Report.pdf`**: A detailed report describing the VPN setup steps, research on encryption/privacy features, and a summary of VPN benefits and limitations.
2.  **`01_VPN_Connected.png`**: Screenshot showing the active VPN connection.
3.  **`02_Original_IP.png`**: Screenshot of the IP address before connection.
4.  **`03_Verified_New_IP.png`**: Screenshot verifying the IP address change after connecting (the required connection status screenshot).

## ⚙️ Summary of Steps Performed

1.  **VPN Selection:** A reputable free VPN service ([ProtonVPN/Windscribe]) was selected and signed up for.
2.  **Installation:** The client software was downloaded and installed on the local system.
3.  **Connection:** A connection was established to a server in [State Location, e.g., the Netherlands].
4.  **IP Verification:** The public IP address was verified on `whatismyipaddress.com` before and after connecting to confirm the IP address had been successfully masked.
5.  **Research:** Research was conducted on core VPN features like AES-256 encryption, No-Logs policies, and Kill Switches to understand their privacy implications.
6.  **Report Generation:** A comprehensive report was written detailing the setup, observations (speed comparison), and a final summary of VPN benefits and limitations.

### **Key Finding (IP Masking)**

* **Original IP/Location:** [Your actual IP Address / Your actual Location]
* **VPN IP/Location:** [VPN Server's IP Address / VPN Server's Location]

## 📊 Summary of VPN Benefits and Limitations (For your Report)

*(This section should contain the detailed summary you write for step 8 of the task, focusing on the research you conducted. Below is a concise placeholder.)*

**Benefits:**
* **Data Encryption:** Protects data from ISPs, hackers, and surveillance using standards like AES-256.
* **Privacy/Anonymity:** Hides the user's real IP address and location.
* **Access Control:** Allows access to geo-restricted content.

**Limitations:**
* **Reduced Speed:** Encryption and rerouting traffic often results in slower internet speeds.
* **Trust in Provider:** Security depends entirely on the VPN's no-log policy and security practices.
* **Cost:** The most reliable services are generally paid.
